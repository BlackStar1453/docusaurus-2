**Default Service Providers**

A default service provider refers to different LLMs, which you can think of as AI systems from different companies. Various LLMs might offer different levels of support for different languages. For example, DeepSeek, developed by a Chinese company, might be more effective for learning Chinese, while Mistral, created by a European company, could be better for learning European languages like French, German, or Italian.

### Free Default Service Providers

Among the selectable service providers, the free options are: ChatGPT (Web), Kimi, and ChatGLM.

#### ChatGPT (Web)

ChatGPT (Web) can only be used if you are able to access ChatGPT normally and remain logged in. If you encounter issues using ChatGPT (Web) for the first time, please follow the [tutorial] to resolve them step by step.

#### Kimi/ChatGLM

These LLMs, developed by a Chinese company, can be used directly within mainland China. Simply register an account, log in, and then **restart GPT-Tutor**.

### Paid Service Providers

Paid service providers require an [API key](APIkey.md).

#### OpenAI/Gemini/Claude

For users outside China, it is recommended to use these three paid service providers.

#### DeepSeek/Grog

For users within mainland China, it is recommended to use these two paid service providers, which offer some free usage upon registration.
