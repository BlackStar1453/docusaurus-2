### Add to Review

GPT-Tutor offers two methods for review:

1. Connect to Anki and complete the review by adding to Anki.
2. Use the built-in review function of GPT-Tutor. If you need to complete the review on a mobile device, Anki is recommended. If you only need to complete the review on a computer, then the built-in review function of GPT-Tutor is suggested.

##### 2. Select a vocabulary book you need to learn and review

##### 3. Set the review interval and the number of words to learn each time

- The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve proves that to remember something long-term, it needs to be reviewed and reinforced at specific intervals. Anki conducts reviews based on this curve, and GPT-Tutor offers a similar review method.

- Besides offering standard memory cycles, GPT-Tutor allows for quick and easy adjustment of these cycles because each person's memory cycle might differ. You can adjust your memory cycle by changing the review intervals.

- After setting the memory cycle, GPT-Tutor will draw a study plan chart (as shown). Based on the current cycle and the number of words learned each session, the chart calculates the time needed to complete the learning and review of the entire vocabulary book and the number of words needed to review each day.
