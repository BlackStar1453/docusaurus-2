### API Models

Within the same [service provider (LLM)](provider.md), the functionality can vary greatly depending on the chosen model. For instance, in ChatGPT, the paid GPT-4 model can correctly interpret the Chinese term “童养媳” (child bride), while the free GPT-3.5 model might mistakenly understand it as "daughter-in-law."

You can find information about better models on the official website or through search engines. Better models generally provide superior performance but come at a higher cost and often have slower response times. If you need to balance cost and performance, you should determine which questions require a more advanced model and which can be handled by a standard model, and then configure these settings in the [Action Simulator].
