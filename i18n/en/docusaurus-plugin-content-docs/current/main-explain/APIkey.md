### API Keys

An API key is like a utility card for water and electricity. Just as you need this card to use water and electricity, you need an API key to access the services provided by this [provider](provider.md). It is highly recommended to add a paid service provider in addition to the free ones. Paid service providers offer superior API models, ensuring that the AI teacher provides accurate and complete answers for complex questions. 

If you don’t use the service frequently, the cost of a paid service provider is relatively low. Typically, each paid service provider offers a certain amount of free usage upon registration, which is usually sufficient for some time. Additionally, you can find cheaper “utility cards” through third-party platforms.
