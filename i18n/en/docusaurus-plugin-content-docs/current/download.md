## Download GPT-Tutor

GPT-Tutor is currently available for download in two ways: you can directly download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gpt-tutor/icbphcgipdflenaemgkhmigfiaelpbnn?hl=en), or you can download the zip file from [GitHub], unzip it, and import it into Chrome.

If you are in Mainland China and cannot access the Chrome Web Store or GitHub, you can join the QQ group 903770350 to download GPT-Tutor.

### List Files

List files include vocabulary lists, such as the IELTS 3000 core vocabulary; grammar lists, such as Cambridge Basic Grammar in Use. You can import these lists into GPT-Tutor so that you do not need to manually enter each word every time, making your learning more systematic.

All available lists can be directly downloaded from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GPT-language/gpt-tutor-resources).

If you are unable to access GitHub in China, you can also download them via [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JdVwnXBGF9u72VunAJM2Kg?pwd=5v3a).

### Function Group Files

Depending on the language, test, and learning goals, different function group files are available. For example, compared to "English Vocabulary Learning," the "German Vocabulary Learning" function group includes an additional feature for "Word Parts of Speech."

Similarly, all function group files can be directly downloaded from the [repository](https://github.com/GPT-language/gpt-tutor-resources).
