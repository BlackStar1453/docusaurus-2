## Get Involved in Discussions and Development

You don't need to be a programmer to contribute to gpt-tutor. If you're learning a language, are a native speaker, a language teacher, or have experience and ideas on how to use AI for language learning, you can join this project and help others learn the language.

You can contribute by submitting PRs or issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/GPT-language/gpt-tutor) or join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JrNrUs72Jn).

### How Programmers Can Contribute

I've been learning to code for just over a year, so my skills and experience are quite limited. I greatly need more experienced programmers to help with development.

1. **Feature Implementation Suggestions**

   I have a series of future features planned, and I'd love to get suggestions on how to implement them. You can view my development roadmap here (coming soon).

2. **Code Improvement**

   Help refine and improve the existing codebase.

3. **Developing Other Clients**

   While the OpenAI-Translator project has Firefox and cross-platform desktop applications, I could only complete the Chrome version of GPT-Tutor due to my limited ability and time. I hope others can help with porting it to other platforms.

### How Language Teachers Can Contribute

1. **Uploading Resources**

   If you have organized language resources, like a French C2 vocabulary book, please upload them to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GPT-language/gpt-tutor-resources/tree/main) or email them to me at (yaozeng1999@gmail.com).

2. **Sharing Language Learning Methods**

   You can try to implement your language learning methods using AI and share them on GPT-Tutor. For detailed instructions, please refer to the following video (coming soon).
