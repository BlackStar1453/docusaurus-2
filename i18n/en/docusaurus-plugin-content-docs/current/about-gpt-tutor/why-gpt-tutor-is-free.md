## Why Free

The current version of GPT-Tutor is free because it incurs no additional costs to run (aside from my time). If future updates introduce extra costs and it becomes necessary to maintain GPT-Tutor's operations, a paid version may be introduced. However, all current features will remain free.

## Why Open Source

In one sentence: I see the potential of GPT-Tutor and the feasibility of AI in education, but my experience and skills are limited. I hope the open-source community can continue to develop this project.

## Why I Decided to Make it Free and Open Source

Around January 2023, the earliest version of GPT-Tutor was released. Initially, GPT-Tutor was a paid service, and the price was relatively high because I believed its powerful features were worth paying for. In fact, I did gain the first batch of paying users (thank you for your support!), which brought me my first income.

After earning my first income and receiving positive feedback, I became more convinced that this path was viable, so I fully committed to the development of GPT-Tutor, working tirelessly from January 2023 to now. By the end of July 2024, I finally completed the new version of GPT-Tutor, which is more comprehensive and user-friendly than the initial paid version. However, I suddenly decided to make everything free and open source.

The reason might seem hard to understand, but it is true: during the development of GPT-Tutor, I saw **a possibility, a chance for everyone to access quality education.**

### A Possibility

I live in a small town with poor education, especially in language education. Most of our elementary, middle, and high school English teachers have incorrect pronunciation, let alone standard ones. They can't explain the numerous "tricky" problems in language learning. Most of the time, we could only stick to a textbook, listen to mechanically pronounced tapes, and memorize words endlessly. Without a qualified teacher, a suitable textbook, or effective learning methods, we put in ten times the effort only to end up with disappointing exam results.

We thought our abilities were lacking, that we had no talent for languages, or poor memory. But later, I realized it wasn't about talent; it was **a lack of language environment and educational resources.**

Some people (like my classmate A) started learning English in kindergarten, watching English cartoons, reading fairy tales, knowing words in elementary school that I only learned in high school. Their middle school English teacher was a native speaker, and their parents spoke fluent English and read English novels. Meanwhile, our only language environment consisted of a few classes a week with a teacher who had poor pronunciation and incomprehensible textbooks. How could we possibly learn well?

The lack of language education resources made us inherently "handicapped" in language learning. Those with exceptional language talent (a rare few) could catch up with enough effort, but the majority of us inevitably became "lifelong English handicapped." However, the emergence of ChatGPT made me see **the possibility of changing all this.** AI can be the miracle worker that cures our "lifelong language handicap" or at least ensures that the next generation doesn't suffer from our poor language education.

**GPT-Tutor can really change everything.** It can replace subpar language education. We don't need teachers who barely understand the material themselves, or dry, rigid textbooks, or mechanical pronunciation from tapes. We need **GPT-Tutor**, a patient, friendly teacher available 24/7. It offers accurate word pronunciation, real-life video pronunciations, and explanations for complex grammar questions. It can help with reading and writing practice.

**GPT-Tutor might not surpass my classmate's language education (although I believe it can with the right methods), but it is vastly superior to the education in my small town.**

Finding an English teacher at GPT-Tutor's level might require a native speaker who is also a language expert, typically very expensive and unaffordable for most people. Even if you could hire such a teacher, they wouldn't be available 24/7, whereas **GPT-Tutor only needs a computer to do so** (and will support mobile devices in the future).

This is the possibility I see: **AI can be applied in language education (and beyond in the future), acting as a competent and patient tutor (or more accurately, an assistant teacher), ensuring that even in densely populated areas with extremely unequal educational resources, everyone has access to quality language education.** It is challenging to send high-level language teachers to such areas, but it's much easier to send a computer or a mobile device.

In my vision, GPT-Tutor will eventually be a learning platform powered by AI, establishing a new teacher-AI assistant-student education model. This model will be far more efficient, convenient, and high-quality than traditional education. In the future, even children in remote areas can get quality education with a device capable of running LLMs (a moderately configured phone).

This is a beautiful vision and a grand project. The current GPT-Tutor is just a **prototype**. Although I have a rough plan on how to achieve it, I can't complete it alone. I've been coding for just over a year, lacking the experience and ability. I also don't have the financial resources to sustain the development. So I hope to **pass the baton**, introducing my **AI learning philosophy and educational model**, specific implementation plans, and providing an MVP (the current GPT-Tutor version). Then, I hope the open-source community will help me continue this tool.

I sincerely hope to personally realize my vision of GPT-Tutor, but if I can't, I hope **a future fork of GPT-Tutor** will become such a platform.
