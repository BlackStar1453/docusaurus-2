## Things to Consider Before Using AI for Learning

If you're new to using AI for language learning, here are some important points you should know before you begin.

**Firstly, it's essential to understand that AI tutors can make mistakes! Even with the best large language models (LLMs) and premium versions, AI tutors can generally handle most language learning issues accurately, but they might still provide incorrect answers, especially with less common languages or more complex queries.**

Just like the success of a magic spell depends on the wizard, the wand, and the incantation, the accuracy of an AI's answers depends on several factors. It's particularly important to remember that, like human teachers, **AI tutors can also make errors**.

1. The LLM you choose (referred to as the provider in gpt-tutor) can make a difference. Different LLMs have varying levels of support for different languages. For example, Mistral, developed by a European company, might be more effective for learning European languages such as French, German, or Italian.

2. Within the same LLM, different models can have significantly different capabilities. For instance, in ChatGPT, the paid GPT-4 model can accurately explain the unique Chinese term "童养媳" (child bride), while the free GPT-3.5 model might mistakenly interpret it as daughter-in-law.

3. The responses from the same model can vary widely depending on the prompt settings. Think of prompts as the incantations for AI spells or the guidelines for asking questions to AI tutors. **If you don't follow these guidelines, the AI tutor might give incorrect or non-standard answers.**

4. Even with the best LLMs and premium models, AI tutors can usually handle most language learning issues correctly but may still provide incorrect answers, particularly with less common languages or more complex questions. This is normal. You can try switching to a better provider, using a more advanced model, adjusting your prompt, or **seeking help from other tutors**.
