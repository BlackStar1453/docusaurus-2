## Why Use a Paid Provider

It is highly recommended to use a paid service provider alongside a free one because paid providers can offer better [API models](/docs/main-explain/APImodel.md). When AI teachers need to answer complex questions, using better models ensures the accuracy and completeness of the responses. If the frequency of use is not high, the cost of paid service providers is not expensive, and usually, each paid service provider offers a certain amount of "utility credits" upon registration, which are sufficient for you to use for some time.

### What is an API Key

Paid service providers require an API key. An API key is like a utility card you use for water and electricity. Just as you need this card to use water and electricity, you also need an API key to use the services provided by this [provider](/docs/main-explain/provider.md).

### How to Obtain an API Key

Create it after registering an account on the official website of various providers. You can also buy cheaper API keys from third-party sources.
